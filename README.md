# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Goal

The goal of the project is to build a PID controller and tune the PID hyperparameters so vehicle is able to drive one lap in the simulator.

## Reflection

Student describes the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in their implementation. Is it what you expected?

Visual aids are encouraged, i.e. record of a small video of the car in the simulator and describe what each component is set to.

Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

Student discusses how they chose the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients). This could be have been done through manual tuning, twiddle, SGD, or something else, or a combination!
